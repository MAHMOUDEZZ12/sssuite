# Super Sales Suite (S3)

## Overview
Super Sales Suite (S3) is a **real estate–focused AI productivity hub**.  
It connects **projects, brands, storage, and sales tools** into one unified system that empowers agents to create, manage, and sell faster.  

The system is built on a **modular architecture**: each feature is an AI-driven service card that plugs into a shared core (auth, storage, brand kit, project library).

---

## Core Concepts
- **Projects** → AI-curated library, stored per user.  
- **Brand Kit** → logos, colors, contact info applied across tools.  
- **Storage** → central bucket for uploads, connected to projects and outputs.  
- **Service Cards** → independent AI-powered tools (ads, reels, emails, PDFs, etc.).  
- **AI Co-Pilot** → assistant that guides flows, connects data, and suggests next steps.
