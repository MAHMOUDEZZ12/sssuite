  1.  **Brand Information**: Look for company name, contact details (name, phone, email), and brand colors (provide as hex codes if possible).
  2.  **Projects**: Identify a list of current or past projects, including their name, location, and status if available.

  Once you have extracted the information, provide a brief, human-readable summary of what you have done. For example: "I've updated your brand with the details from 'CompanyProfile.pdf' and created 5 new projects from 'ProjectList.csv'."
